# SSC labs with Lorand Szakacs

Hello folks, I hold the labs on:
1. Tuesday, 16-18, in B528b
2. Wednesday, 18-20, in B528b

## Contact
You can always send my an email at `lsz@lorandszakacs.com`. Please make sure that the subject contains the string `[ssc2016]`, otherwise you risk having your email be read way too late :)

## General workflow

We will always be working on pre-configured virtual machines, which you can download from here: [http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/lab_env.html](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/lab_env.html). You can obviously make use of these at home as well, nay, it is actually encouraged :)

## Your obligations

Each lab will have to be read in advance. Don't worry, plenty of resources will be provided. Show up for all labs, except in extraneous circumstances, don't worry here either, I'm very understanding of personal issues that might prevent attending a lab.  

Be curious, ask questions, and play around :)

## Presentations

During weeks 9-10 you will have the possibility of give a presentation to your peers about a related subject. Pick a topic, ask for guidance, whatever you need, and make it happen. Rewards will be plentiful.

## Recuperating lost labs

In case you cannot make it to a lab try attending one of the other three labs, in any given week. The later you recuperate a lab, the more knowledge you'll have to display. Be prepared!

## No "hacking" the physical machines

You should leave the state of the OS and file system more or less intact when you leave the lab. Messing around with the local network, or file system outside of the Virtual Machines is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated.

## Grades

Are horrible. But we are constrained by a ridiculously inflexible system which assumes the existence of this barbaric method of measurement. Therefore, your `final grade = 50% average from labs + 50% exams`.   

Each lab will have a short 5-10 minute quiz (3-4 questions) about the topic at hand. The said quiz will be worth between 30-40% of each lab; so please remember your obligations for this lab :)
